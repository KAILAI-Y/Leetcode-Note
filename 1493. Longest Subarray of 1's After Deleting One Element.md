# 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

[1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element | Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) `Sliding window`

### Problem Description
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`'s in the resulting array. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.

### Solution Strategy
1. Initialize a sliding window at the start of the array. Extend the window to the right by incrementing `end` pointer.
2. When you encounter a zero, increment a counter for the number of zeros in the window. If this counter goes above 1, move the `start` pointer of the window to the right until the counter goes back to 1.
3. Keep extending the window to the right until `end` pointer reaches the end of the array. Record the maximum size of the window seen.

```Python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        zeros = 0
        max_len = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zeros += 1

            while zeros > 1:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zeros -= 1
                left += 1

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left)

        return max_len
