# 1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

[1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length | Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) `Sliding window`

### Problem Description
Given a string s and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.


### Solution Strategy
This problem can be solved by using the Sliding Window technique. The idea is to keep a window of length k and slide it over the string, while maintaining the count of vowels in the current window. Each time we slide the window, we subtract the count for the letter going out and add the count for the letter coming in. We keep track of the maximum count of vowels we have seen.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = set('aeiou')
        window_vowels = sum(1 for i in range(k) if s[i] in vowels)
        max_vowels = window_vowels
        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            window_vowels += (s[i] in vowels) - (s[i-k] in vowels)
            max_vowels = max(max_vowels, window_vowels)
        return max_vowels
```
