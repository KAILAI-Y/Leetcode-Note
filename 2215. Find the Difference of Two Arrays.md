# 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays

[2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays | Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) `Hashmap` 

### Problem Description
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list answer of size `2` where:

`answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
`answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

Example:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
class Solution:
    def findDifferenceOfTwoArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums1_set, nums2_set = set(nums1), set(nums2)
        answer = [[num for num in nums1_set if num not in nums2_set],
                  [num for num in nums2_set if num not in nums1_set]]
        return answer
```
