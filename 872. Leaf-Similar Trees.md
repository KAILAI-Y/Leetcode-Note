# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

[872. Leaf-Similar Trees| Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Binary Tree - DFS`

### Problem Description
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

[3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Example 1:
```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(node, leaf_values):
            if node:
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    leaf_values.append(node.val)
                else:
                    dfs(node.left, leaf_values)
                    dfs(node.right, leaf_values)

        
        leaf_values1, leaf_values2 = [], []
        dfs(root1, leaf_values1)
        dfs(root2, leaf_values2)

        return leaf_values1 == leaf_values2
