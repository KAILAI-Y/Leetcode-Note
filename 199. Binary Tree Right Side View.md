# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

[199. Binary Tree Right Side View| Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Binary Tree - BFS`

### Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]
```

### Solution Strategy
- Initiate the list of the right side view `rightside`.

- Initiate two queues: one for the current level,
and one for the next. Add root into `nextLevel` queue.

- While `nextLevel` queue is not empty:
  - Initiate the current level: `currLevel = nextLevel`,
and empty the next level `nextLevel`.

  - While current level queue is not empty:

    - Pop out a node from the current level queue.

    - Add first left and then right child node into `nextLevel`
    queue.

  - Now `currLevel` is empty, and the node we have in hands
is the last one, and makes a part of the right side view.
Add it into `rightside`.

- Return `rightside`.

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []

        next_level = deque([root])
        result = []

        while next_level:
            current_level = next_level
            next_level = deque()

            while current_level:
                node = current_level.popleft()

                if node.left:
                    next_level.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    next_level.append(node.right)
            
            result.append(node.val)

        return result

```
* **Time Complexity**: O(N) since one has to visit each node.
* **Space Complexity**: O(D) to keep the queues,
where D is a tree diameter.
