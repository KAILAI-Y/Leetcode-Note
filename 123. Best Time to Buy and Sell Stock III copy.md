# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

[123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III | Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/) `Dynamic Programming`

### Problem Description
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. You may complete at most two transactions. Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Solution Strategy
In this case, we keep track of the minimum price during the first buy `buy1`, maximum profit after the first sell `profit1`, minimum price after the first sell taking into account the first profit (i.e., we subtract `profit1` from the current price, `buy2`), and the maximum profit at the end `profit2`.

We start by setting `buy1` and `buy2` to infinity and `profit1` and `profit2` to 0. Then, for each price, we update our variables.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy1, buy2 = float('inf'), float('inf')
        profit1, profit2 = 0, 0
        
        for price in prices:
            buy1 = min(buy1, price)
            profit1 = max(profit1, price - buy1)
            buy2 = min(buy2, price - profit1)
            profit2 = max(profit2, price - buy2)
            
        return profit2
```
*  `buy2 = min(buy2, price - profit1)` 等于 `price - (price - buy1)`，也就是 buy1。这样就等同于我们在第一次卖出股票后，手里有了 profit1 的资金，然后我们用这些钱去购买第二只股票。理想情况下，`price - profit1` 应该是负数，意味着我们用从第一次交易中赚到的钱去购买第二只股票，还剩余一些钱。
