# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

[122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II | Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/) `Dynamic Programming`

### Problem Description
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

### Solution Strategy
In this case, we iterate over the list of prices, and whenever we see a price greater than the previous day's price, we consider it as a profit opportunity and add it to our total profit.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit  = 0
        sumprofit = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
                sumprofit += profit
        return sumprofit
```

* **Space Complexity**: O(1)
