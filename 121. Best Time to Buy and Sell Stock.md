# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/) `Dynamic Programming` `Kadane's Algorithm`

### Problem Description
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Solution Strategy
We define `dp` as the maximum profit that can be obtained from selling the stock on the `i-th` day, and it is initialized to 0. As we traverse the list of prices, we calculate the difference `nums` between the current price and the previous price. The `dp` for the current day is then calculated as the maximum of `dp` from the previous day plus `nums`, or `nums` itself. The `maxprofit` is then updated as the maximum of `maxprofit` and `dp`.

This strategy works because it uses the principle of `Kadane's Algorithm`, which is about finding the sum of a contiguous subarray in an array with the largest sum. In this case, the sum of the subarray is equivalent to the profit from selling stocks.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = 0
        maxprofit = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            nums = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
            dp = max(dp + nums, nums)
            maxprofit = max(dp, maxprofit)
        return maxprofit
```
* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Testcase
```Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]```
```nums: -6 4 -2 3 -2```
```dp: -6 4 2 5 3```
```maxprofit: 0 4 4 5 5```

| -1 |   | 1 |   | 6 |    | 4 |
|----|---|---|---|---|----|---|
|    | 2 |   | 5 |   | -2 |   |
|    | 2 |   | 7 |   | 5  |   |


* -1 <-a- 1 <-b- 6
* -1 <----c---- 6
* c = a + b
