# 547. Number of Provinces

[547. Number of Provinces| Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Graph - DFS`

### Problem Description
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(i):
            for j in range(provinces):
                if isConnected[i][j] == 1 and j not in visited:
                    visited.add(j)
                    dfs(j)

        provinces = len(isConnected)
        visited = set()
        count = 0

        for i in range(provinces):
            if i not in visited:
                dfs(i)
                count += 1

        return count
