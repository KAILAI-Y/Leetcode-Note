# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

[1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree| Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Binary Tree - DFS`

### Problem Description
Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node: TreeNode, max_value: int) -> int:
            if node is None:
                return 0
            max_value = max(max_value, node.val)
            return (node.val >= max_value) + dfs(node.left, max_value) + dfs(node.right, max_value)

        return dfs(root, root.val)
