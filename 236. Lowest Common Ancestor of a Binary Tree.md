# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree| Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Binary Tree - DFS`

### Problem Description
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root or root == p or root == q:
            return root

        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        if not left:
            return right
        elif not right:
            return left
        else:
            return root
```
