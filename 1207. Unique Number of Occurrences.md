# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

[1207. Unique Number of Occurrences | Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) `Hashmap` 

### Problem Description
Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or `false` otherwise.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        count_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            if num in count_map:
                count_map[num] += 1
            else:
                count_map[num] = 1
                
        count_set = set(count_map.values())
        
        return len(count_set) == len(count_map)

```
