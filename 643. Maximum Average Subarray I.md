# 643. Maximum Average Subarray I

[643. Maximum Average Subarray I | Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) `Sliding window`

### Problem Description
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10^-5` will be accepted.


### Solution Strategy
Start from the beginning of the array, keep adding the elements to the sum until we have `k` elements, calculate the average, and update the maximum average. Then, slide the window by one element (subtracting the element going out of the window and adding the element now being included in the window), and update the maximum average if required.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        left = 0
        window_sum = 0
        max_average = float('-inf')

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            window_sum += nums[right]  # add the next element

            # Check if we have 'k' elements in the window
            if right - left + 1 >= k:
                average = window_sum / k  # calculate the average
                max_average = max(max_average, average)  # update the max_average if required
                window_sum -= nums[left]  # subtract the element going out
                left += 1  # slide the window ahead

        return max_average
