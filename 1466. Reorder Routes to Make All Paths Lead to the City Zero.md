# 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero

[1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero| Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75) `Graph - DFS`

### Problem Description
There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a road from city ai to city bi.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

### Solution Strategy
```Python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        edges = set()

        # 构建图和边集
        for u, v in connections:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
            edges.add((u, v))
        print(edges)

        return self.dfs(graph, edges, 0, set())

        

    # 深度优先搜索
    def dfs(self, graph, edges, node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        return sum((node, nei) in edges for nei in graph[node] if nei not in visited) + \
        sum(self.dfs(graph, edges, nei, visited) for nei in graph[node] if nei not in visited)
```
