# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

[1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs | Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/?envType=study-plan-v2&id=leetcode-75) ```Two-Pointers```

### Problem Description
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array. Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

### Solution Strategy
The question can be solved by using the two-pointer technique. Sort the array first. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. Then check the sum of the two numbers at the pointers. If it equals k, increase the count of pairs and move both pointers inward. If the sum is less than k, move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than k, move the right pointer to the left.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        count = 0

        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] == k:
                count += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif nums[left] + nums[right] < k:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return count
```
* **Time Complexity**: O(nlongn) because of the sorting.
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)
