# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

[188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV | Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/) `Dynamic Programming`

### Problem Description
Given an integer array `prices` where each element is the price of a given stock on a particular day, and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can achieve from making at most `k` transactions. In each transaction, you can buy one stock and sell one stock

### Solution Strategy
Create two 2D arrays `buy` and `sell` where `buy[i][j]` represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by making at most `j` transactions and having a stock on the `i`-th day, while `sell[i][j]` represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by making at most `j` transactions and not having a stock on the `i`-th day.

```Python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0

        n = len(prices)
        k = min(k, n // 2)
        buy = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n)]
        sell = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n)]
        buy[0][0], sell[0][0] = -prices[0], 0

        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            buy[0][i] = sell[0][i] = float('-inf')

        for i in range(1, n):
            buy[i][0] = max(buy[i - 1][0], sell[i - 1][0] - prices[i])
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                buy[i][j] = max(buy[i - 1][j], sell[i - 1][j] - prices[i])
                sell[i][j] = max(sell[i - 1][j], buy[i - 1][j - 1] + prices[i])

        return max(sell[n - 1])
```
* For each transaction, you need to buy and sell a stock, which requires 2 days. Therefore, the maximum number of transactions you can make is n // 2 where n is the number of given days.
 \
 If k is larger than n // 2, it means that you are allowed to make more transactions than the maximum possible number. In this case, you can consider this problem as "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II" where you are allowed to make as many transactions as you like. 
 
 
* **Time Complexity**: O(n*k)
* **Space Complexity**: O(n*k)
